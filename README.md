## Description

The package is an extension to the `interval` package written by Lars Madsen. Apart from the `\interval` macro which is the same, the also package helps typeset different mathematical relations between intervals:
- `\xinterval` for interval product
- `\uinterval` for interval union
- `\ninterval` for interval intersection

In addition, an `\ineq` macro is provided to typeset inequalities. Its use is fairly similar to that of `\interval`.
